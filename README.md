# Elevator app using Java Programming Language.
-Currently it is an implementation of two elevators. The plan is to have 5 elevators work asynchronously while their logs are stored on the mySQL database.

*How the System works:*
-Both elevators are positioned on the first floor and once called to a certain floor, the elevators move to the floor requested. The elevators then move to the floor that is closest to them to enhance efficiency.
